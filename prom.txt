A promise is an object that represents the completion of an event of an asynchronous operation and its 
result.
A promise:
• Improves code readability
• Handles asynchronous operations
• Handles errors
A promise has the following states:
• fulfilled: When the promise is a success
• rejected: When the promise is a failure
• pending: When the promise is in a pending state
• settled: When the promise is complete
